                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">LEducation in India is primarily managed by state-run public 
                    education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, 
                    state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 
                    2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                    The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. 
                    Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. 
                    The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state
                    governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states 
                    and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for
                    elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and
                    policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed 
                    elementary schools is growing. </p>

                        hence guaranteeing value-for-money education.

                        Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
                        
                        This vastness of the Indian education system directly translates to enhanced opportunities for its students and global learning for an all-round 
                        academic and personal development.

                        from Indian campuses.
